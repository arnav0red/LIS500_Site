        <h1>Resources for Implicit Bias</h1>
        <section class="resource-category">
            <p>
                Welcome to the resource page on implicit bias (IB). This guide is designed for students who are just
                starting to
                explore the ways our thoughts, experiences, and social context can influence how we perceive and
                interact
                with
                others. Here, you'll find explanations, key concepts like intersectionality, the Implicit Bias Test
                (IBT),
                and
                links to beginner-friendly resources.

            <h2>What is Implicit Bias?</h2>
            <p>
                Implicit bias, also known as implicit prejudice or implicit attitude, is a negative attitude, of which
                one is not consciously aware, against a specific social group.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implicit bias is thought to be shaped by experience and based on learned associations between particular
                qualities and social categories, including race and/or gender. Individuals’ perceptions and behaviors
                can be
                influenced by the implicit biases they hold, even if they are unaware they hold such biases. Implicit
                bias
                is an
                aspect of implicit social cognition: the phenomenon that perceptions, attitudes, and stereotypes can
                operate
                prior to conscious intention or endorsement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why it matters:
                Even when we consciously believe in equality and fairness, implicit biases can influence everyday
                decisions—like
                how we interact with classmates, professors, or colleagues. Recognizing these biases is the first step
                toward
                creating a more inclusive environment.

            <h2> The Implicit Association Test (IAT)</h2>
            <p>
                The IAT is a tool designed to help people discover their own unconscious biases. It's not a judgment,
                but a
                starting point for reflection. Many students find it surprising to learn how their brain associates
                different
                traits with gender, race, or other social categories.

            <h2>
                Intersectionality</h2>
            <p>

                Intersectionality is a term coined in the late 1980s by American academic Kimberlé Crenshaw. It
                describes
                how
                race, class, gender and other personal characteristics 'intersect' with one another and overlap. She
                wanted
                to
                remind people that when thinking about equality, we need to think beyond singular attributes like skin
                colour
                and gender, and recognise that all humans have more than one characteristic that may be subject to
                discrimination or hostility. For example, while a woman may experience sexism, a black lesbian may be at
                risk of
                experiencing not only sexism but also racism and homophobia. However, by listening to and respecting
                people
                when
                they share their lives with you, you can being to understand their intersectional experiences.
