            <h2>Michael Running Wolf</h2>
            <p>
                Michael Running Wolf is a Native American software engineer and AI researcher dedicated to using
                technology
                to preserve Indigenous languages. He is the founder of Indigenous in AI, a platform that elevates
                Indigenous
                voices in machine learning and AI research. Running Wolf has a Master's in Computer Science, is a former
                engineer for Amazon Alexa, former faculty at Northeastern University, and is pursuing a PhD in Computer
                Science at McGill University.
            </p>
            <p>
                His work focuses on creating automatic speech recognition tools for Indigenous languages, inspired by
                projects like those preserving the Māori language. Through initiatives such as Buffalo Tongue and FLAIR
                (First Languages AI Reality), he develops AI and virtual-reality tools to reclaim threatened languages
                while
                ensuring Indigenous communities maintain ownership and control over their data.
            </p>

                “By elevating the voices of Indigenous ML researchers we will inspire future impactful work and break
                stereotypes.” - Michael Running Wolf

            <p>
                Running Wolf challenges norms in tech by centering Indigenous perspectives in AI,
                showing that technology can be a tool for empowerment rather than erasure.
