        <p>Welcome to our page for LIS 500: Code and Power. This space will be used to share course materials, updates,
            and reflections as we explore how technology and code are shaped by power and societal bias. Throughout the
            course, we will examine how assumptions about race, gender, class, and access become embedded in information
            systems, and what that means for equity and responsibility in technology and information work. </p>
